### Prompt Entry #1

**Timestamp:** 2025-01-27T00:00:00Z

I want you to create a running MD file that adds every prompt that I Send to the AI Editor. Create a cursor rules file in root that also includes a rule that requires the LLM to print all of my sent prompts into the file first and foremost.

Then create a folder named LLM-Notes for the LLM to store all MD files in, and proceed to also include a cursor rule that dictates all MD notes made by the LLM should be stored there.

### Prompt Entry #2

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:28:25Z

I want to create a scalable and dynamic AI powered chatbot application that will have access to external APIs and tools offered by other online services such as google mail, google calendar, etc. I want you to create a thorough notetaking framework for any LLM instance to be able to make and update notes and goals in real time. This system should also have an organized current tasklist, considerations, and dynamicall be able to archive notes when irrelevant or completed.

Add efficient and concise cursor notes to require future LLMs that work on this project to have to also adhere to this system

### Prompt Entry #3

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:32:01Z

Instead of having independent markdown files for each segment, make subfolders so that LLMs wasting unecessary tokens editing each markdown file but instead dump into the appropriate archived files. LLMs should still be able to make small edits to existing MD files but should take agency in reorganizing or archiving context that is not needed anymore. This file system should operate as a dynamic context window for any LLM to be able to clearly pick up progress and continue with development.

Don't forget to update the cursor rules to outline this new protocol.

### Prompt Entry #4

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:36:25Z

Let me re-clarify, there should be an archive folder for entire files to be dumped into with this new pipeline. I want to streamline token usage such that LLMs should not unecessarily have to read and edit files between current implementations and archived notes. When creating note files, its okay to create multiple current independent files in a directory, as the LLM should do its due dilligence in cleaning up irrelevant and no longer necessary files in the appropriate archives. remember to update cursor rules with new specs

### Prompt Entry #5

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:39:09Z

eradicate all the archived-x md files, we are proceeding to the global archived MD system

---

### Prompt Entry #6

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:42:30Z

lets now begin creating a game plan for our project. I want to use Next.js and tailwindcss for this project and want to keep open considerations for what optimal backend stacks will look like. Lets also start add cursor rules to prioritize avoiding hardcoded solutions and shortcuts to meet specifications. The LLM should be honest and able to halt work when implementations do not work and are looping failures and notify the user.

---

### Prompt Entry #7

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:44:00Z

Additionally add cursor rules that dictate LLMs prioritize solutions that are modular and scalable, even though they make take more time and effort to implement.

---

### Prompt Entry #8

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:52:43Z

I want to set up my service using node.js for lower latency and scaling purposes. Create a webpage with a simple chatbox component and create a .env file for me to be able to inject an API key. Ensure that you also create a gitignore and add this env file as well as node modules after installing my stack

---

### Prompt Entry #9

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-17T22:54:52Z

check downloaded modules, ensure we update, remove, or find replacements for any deprecated packages.

---

### Prompt Entry #10

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T01:14:22Z

do a full reinstall on the project dependencies, ensure all tailwind and next.js packages are properly configured and are up to date

---

### Prompt Entry #11

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T01:23:02Z

Lets start fleshing out the basic features of the project scope. Ensure endpoints of the AI are properly hooked for real time conversation. Model the current user experience of having in progress animated text bubbles when the AI is generating a response. Also have editable JSON backend prompting for specific AI personas

---

### Prompt Entry #12

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T01:27:52Z

Enable toggling of the various frontier AI APIs availble as of MON NOV 17 2025. Fetch online information and allow the user to hot swap between models and have particular segments in the .env files

---

### Prompt Entry #13

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T19:54:00Z

after a response finishes, there seems to be a weird slingshot animation before the chatbox settles. check for any edge cases with motion or any other factors that may be contributing to this issue.

I also want you to check the cursorrules file and make a claude rules file to match the protocols. Retroactively sort all of the notes you make in that style and ensure that claude goes through similar development pipelines. If you can add my prompts to the prompt history

---

### Prompt Entry #14

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T20:05:00Z

improve on the interfact with the persona management. Create a more responsive interface with more modernized buttons to fit the overarching theme and animations. I want to be able to also directly manipulate the system prompt and which one the chatbot uses dynamically. Be more concise and thorough with user interface components, such that you can save configurations automatically, but also have a direct and responsive real time feature where the user can hot-swap between JSON files

---

### Prompt Entry #15

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T20:30:00Z

I want the chatbox to dynamically change the chat bubbles to let the user know who they are talking to.

lets also incorporate tools within our application that allows formatting of math problems, genral markdown formatting, and other features that may exist in modern LLM interfaces. Lets remove branding across the application and change it to (B)est Team. limit branding so its more subtle and elegant.

I also want to incorporate general LLM tools that enable the user to upload photos directly or copy and paste screenshots into the chatbox.

One edit I want to make is to have the glowing animation persistent and fade away over three seconds after finishing response generation. Adjacently fix the persistent yellow/blue asset isue with the user's text box, it currently is persistent after the user enters a query despite the glow disappearing

### Prompt Entry #16

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T20:45:00Z

there is a small bug where the colorful outine on the user input box rotates like a propller, can you implement the same styling with the AI generated content highlighting animation? Remove the best team header above the application but change the header title to reflect (B)est Team

---

### Prompt Entry #17

**Timestamp:** 2025-11-18T21:00:00Z

the header element still says stark industries, change this to (B)est Team. Additionally, can you remove the background text within the user interface? By default, when there is no conversation history, I want a simple user input text box. I want to create a more compact user experience in which the page header elements and navigation to the different pages are embedded into subtle page layouts. take inspiration from the claude and gemini interfaces where there is a stoway menu on the left side to manage message history and have the perona configuration there as well.
