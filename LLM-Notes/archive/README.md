# Archive Directory

**Purpose:** This directory serves as a repository for entire files that are no longer actively needed. LLMs should move entire files here when they become outdated, irrelevant, or superseded.

## Usage

- **Move entire files** to this directory when they're no longer needed
- **Don't edit files** in the archive - they're historical records
- **Organize by date or category** if helpful (optional subdirectories)
- **Preserve context** - archived files serve as a historical record

## Token Efficiency

By moving entire files here instead of constantly editing active files, we:

- Minimize token usage from reading/editing large files
- Preserve complete historical context
- Enable LLMs to focus on current, relevant files only
- Create a clear separation between active and archived content
